# TextToSQL

## Project Overview
TextToSQL is a Streamlit application that converts natural language questions into optimized SQL queries using Googleâ€™s Gemini model. The application is designed to help users easily retrieve data from a SQL database by simply asking questions in English. It utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to generate efficient SQL queries.

## Features
- Convert English questions into SQL queries.
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for optimized query generation.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Dummy database for data security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darshit98/TextToSql.git
   cd TextToSql
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Database
For data security, the application uses a dummy database (`student.db`) instead of a real database. This ensures that no sensitive data is exposed during development or testing. You can modify the dummy database as needed for your testing purposes.

### Running the Application
To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Enter your question in the text area provided.
3. Click the "Ask the question" button to generate the SQL query.
4. The generated SQL query will be displayed for your review, and you can retrieve data from the dummy database.
